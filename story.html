  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>
    We didn’t plan this.  
    It unfolded quietly, one conversation at a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Somewhere between comfort and curiosity,
    you became important.With you, I've learned that love isn't about perfection—it's about choosing each other every day.
    I promise to hold your hand through the storms and dance with you in the rain.
